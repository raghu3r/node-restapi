# RESTful API with Node.js and Express.

* What REST is and that it's just basically a set of rules about how an API should behave so that anybody who consumes your API understands basically what's going on at any point. 
* REST verbs - GET, and PUT, and PATCH, and POST, and DELETE - all of these work; and implemented them in Node.js and Express. 
* Built unit and integration tests with Mocha and integration using supertest, and tested some things and holistically, and broke things out into controllers, and made our code testable so that could understand what was going on and fix things easily. 
* What hypermedia was and how to use hypermedia to make our API somewhat self-documenting, and the more you pour into that piece, the easier your API is to use for someone who doesn't necessarily understand what's going on with your API. 

* This is a great starting point to get an API up and running using Node.
